# Super_Bowl.sas

This project uses SAS to predict which NFL teams are most likely to win their conference championship (and potentially reach the Super Bowl) based on regular-season performance metrics. After extensive preprocessing, lagged feature engineering, and modeling with logistic regression, predictions are generated for the 2021â€“2025 seasons.

## Highlights

- Imported and merged team-level stats from [NFL.com](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats) with conference classification data.
- Created lagged features from 100+ variables to reflect performance from the prior season.
- Applied logistic regression with:
  - Stepwise selection (SL entry/stay = 0.3)
  - AIC for model comparison
  - Firth correction to address convergence issues and rare events
- Evaluated model residuals using Pearson and Deviance diagnostics.
- Generated championship predictions for multiple seasons with ranked probabilities.

## Tools Used

- SAS 9.4 / SAS Studio
- `PROC IMPORT`, `PROC LOGISTIC`, `PROC SORT`, `PROC CORR`, `PROC FREQ`
- Stepwise variable selection and Firth correction for logistic models
- Residual diagnostics with `PROC UNIVARIATE` and `PROC SGPLOT`
- Scoring new data with `PRIORMODEL` and `SCORE` statements

## Dataset

- **Source**: Publicly available data from [NFL.com/stats](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/) and [NFL.com/standings](https://www.nfl.com/standings/)
- **NFL_new.csv**: Contains 100+ regular-season metrics and preseason rankings
- **Conferences.xlsx**: Adds contextual grouping by conference and region from [NFL.com/standings](https://www.nfl.com/standings/)
- Data includes 224 team-season observations across 106+ variables, later expanded to over 200 variables with lagged features.

|     2020 | Chiefs (0.896), Ravens (0.217)   | Buccaneers (0.519), 49ers (0.212)  |



## Goal

To determine whether preseason ranking and prior-season team performance can accurately predict NFL conference championship winners, and to assess whether logistic regression with penalization and lag features can outperform traditional metrics.
