# SAS Projects: Forecasting & Classification

Welcome to my collection of SAS-based analytics projects! These scripts demonstrate statistical modeling techniques used for forecasting, classification, and time series analysis. All code was developed as part of my graduate coursework in Data Analytics.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

### 1. `soft_drink_forecasting.sas`
- Implements **Winters' multiplicative method** for forecasting monthly soft drink demand.
- Includes model fitting, forecast evaluation (MAPE, RMSE), and seasonality analysis.

### 2. `classification_models.sas`
- Compares multiple statistical classification methods, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis
  - Classification Trees
- Based on real-world case studies (e.g., business failure prediction, medical diagnosis).

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Due to size or licensing restrictions, original datasets may not be included. However, simulated or anonymized versions are provided in the `/data` folder when possible.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- SAS 9.4+ or access to SAS Studio
- Datasets in `.csv` or `.sas7bdat` format
- No additional libraries required

## ðŸ“˜ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `.sas` files in SAS Studio or your local SAS environment.
3. Modify file paths in the `libname` and `infile` statements to match your local setup.
4. Run scripts section by section to explore model outputs.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

- All models were created for educational purposes.
- Please credit or reference this repo if adapting the code for your own work.
