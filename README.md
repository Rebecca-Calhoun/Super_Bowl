# SAS Projects Portfolio

This repository contains SAS-based projects developed as part of my graduate coursework in Data Analytics. The scripts demonstrate applications of logistic regression, time series forecasting, and classification techniques using real-world datasets. Each project showcases statistical modeling, data preparation, and model evaluation performed in the SAS environment.

## Projects

### Super_Bowl.sas
Forecasts AFC and NFC championship winners using logistic regression. Includes stepwise variable selection, AIC model comparison, and Firth bias correction to improve convergence with small or imbalanced samples.

## Tools & Features Used

- **SAS 9.4+ / SAS Studio** – All code is written in Base SAS using standard procedures and data steps.
- **PROC LOGISTIC** – For binary classification with logistic regression and Firth bias correction.
- **PROC EXPORT / IMPORT** – For reading `.csv` and `.xlsx` datasets.
- **Macro Variables & Stepwise Selection** – To handle iterative modeling and variable filtering.
- **Model Evaluation** – Includes AIC, convergence checking, and prediction accuracy evaluation.
- No external packages or add-ons are required.

## Requirements

- SAS 9.4+ or access to SAS Studio
- Compatible file formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`
- No external libraries or macros required

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.sas` file in SAS Studio or your local SAS environment.
3. Update any file paths in `libname` or `infile` statements to match your local directory.
4. Run the script section-by-section to review model diagnostics and output.

## Notes

- All projects are for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Results and models reflect exploratory work rather than production-level pipelines.
