# SAS Projects: Forecasting & Classification

Welcome to my collection of SAS-based analytics projects! These scripts demonstrate statistical modeling techniques used for forecasting, classification, and time series analysis. All code was developed as part of my graduate coursework in Data Analytics.

## Project Overview

### 1. `Super_Bowl.sas`
- Implements **Logistic Regression** for forecasting AFC and NFC winners (teams that will play in the Super Bowl).
- Includes stepwise with entry/stay of 0.3, AIC analysis, and Firth to address convergence.



## Datasets
- NFL_new.csv: Data extracted from [NFL.com/team-stats/stats](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/) for over 100 variables for seasons 2019-2024, plus pre-season power rankings from NFL.com
- Conferences.xlsx: Data extracted from https://www.nfl.com/standings/ regarding team locations, conferences, and regions.

## Requirements

- SAS 9.4+ or access to SAS Studio
- Datasets in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format
- No additional libraries required

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `.sas` files in SAS Studio or your local SAS environment.
3. Modify file paths in the `libname` and `infile` statements to match your local setup.
4. Run scripts section by section to explore model outputs.

## Notes

- All models were created for educational purposes.
- Please credit or reference this repo if adapting the code for your own work.
