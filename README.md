# SAS Projects Portfolio

This repository contains SAS-based projects developed as part of my graduate coursework in Data Analytics. The scripts demonstrate applications of logistic regression, time series forecasting, and classification techniques using real-world datasets. Each project showcases statistical modeling, data preparation, and model evaluation performed in the SAS environment.

## Project Highlights

### `Super_Bowl.sas`
Forecasts AFC and NFC championship winners using logistic regression. Includes stepwise variable selection, AIC model comparison, and Firth bias correction to improve convergence with small or imbalanced samples.

## Datasets

- `NFL_new.csv`: Team-level statistics from [NFL.com/stats](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/) across 2019â€“2024 seasons, including over 100 variables and preseason power rankings.
- `Conferences.xlsx`: Team location, conference, and division data from [NFL.com/standings](https://www.nfl.com/standings/).


## Requirements

- SAS 9.4+ or access to SAS Studio
- Compatible file formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`
- No external libraries or macros required

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.sas` file in SAS Studio or your local SAS environment.
3. Update any file paths in `libname` or `infile` statements to match your local directory.
4. Run the script section-by-section to review model diagnostics and output.

## Notes

- All projects are for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Results and models reflect exploratory work rather than production-level pipelines.
